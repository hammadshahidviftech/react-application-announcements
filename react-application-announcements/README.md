## Minimal Path to Awesome

- Clone this repository
- Create the announcements list in SharePoint
- `npm install`
- `gulp serve`
- Open a browser on a SharePoint site having the appropriate announcements list and append this query string to the URL (remember to change the `siteUrl` and `listName`!)
```
?loadSPFX=true&debugManifestsFile=https://localhost:4321/temp/manifests.js&customActions={"dd7ec4fd-97aa-44c5-b6ad-87535862e0bf":{"location":"ClientSideExtension.ApplicationCustomizer","properties":{"listName":"Site Announcements","siteUrl": "/sites/Contoso"}}}
```

### Announcements list columns

The Announcements list must have the following columns. Also note that a PnP Provisioning template is provided in `sharepoint/assets/pnptemplate.xml` that can (and should!) be used to deploy the list.

Column|Type|Values
------|----|------
Locale|Choice|`en-US`, `fr-FR`, `es-ES`, ...
Announcement|Note|
Link|URL|
Urgent|Boolean|
StartDateTime|DateTime|
EndDateTime|DateTime|

### Build and deploy

  - `npm i`
  - `gulp clean`
  - `gulp bundle --ship`
  - `gulp build --ship`
  - `gulp package-solution --ship`
  - Deploy the app package (`sharepoint/solution/react-application-announcements.spkg`) to your tenant AppCatalog
  - Deploy a list with the appropriate fields
  - Add the extension custom action with the appropriate settings

### Using PnPPowerShell

To deploy the announcements list and add the custom action to your desired site, the easiest solution is using PnPPowerShell.

1. Install PnPPowerShell `Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline`
1. Connect to your site `Connect-PnPOnline https://MyTenant.sharepoint.com/sites/MySite`
1. Deploy the PnP Provisioning template `Apply-PnPProvisioningTemplate sharepoint\assets\pnptemplate.xml -Handlers Fields,ContentTypes,Lists`
1. Add the custom action (remember to replace Contoso in the ClientSideComponentProperties by your site name) `Add-PnPCustomAction -Name "Announcements" -Title "Announcements" -Location "ClientSideExtension.ApplicationCustomizer" -ClientSideComponentId "dd7ec4fd-97aa-44c5-b6ad-87535862e0bf" -ClientSideComponentProperties="{&quot;listName&quot;:&quot;Site Announcements&quot;, &quot;siteUrl&quot;:&quot;/sites/Contoso&quot;}"`

Also, note that the template file also includes an example on how to deploy an extension on a site. This requires the app to be deployed to the app catalog
